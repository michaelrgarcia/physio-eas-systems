      <h1>The Physiological Effects of Alert Systems</h1>
      <p>
        Emergency alert systems play a critical role in public safety, providing
        timely warnings during disasters and emergencies. Two prominent systems
        in the United States are the Emergency Alert System (EAS) and Wireless
        Emergency Alerts (WEAs). While both systems aim to save lives, their
        design and delivery impact their effectiveness and the physiological
        stress responses they elicit. This paper examines how these systems
        function, explores the physiological effects of emergency alerts, and
        highlights the advantages of WEAs over EAS, while addressing gaps in
        accessibility and equity.
